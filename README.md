 # Python (FastAPI, Pymotyc) backend and MongoDB in Docker Compose

This repository is an example project that shows how to:

1. Setup and run `MongoDB` container.
2. Create some models and CRUD operations for `MongoDB` it in `Pymotyc` - a simple yet powerful `Python` library, but with funny quirks.
3. Create a backend in `FastAPI` - another `Python` library.
4. Wrap it all in `Docker Compose`.
